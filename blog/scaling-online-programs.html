            <p>Scaling an online program isn't just about adding more students. It's about building systems, processes, and partnerships that support learners at every step. Whether you're at a university, a nonprofit, or a corporate training program, these strategies from leading institutions can help you grow sustainably.</p>

            <h2>1. Automate Your Administrative Needs</h2>

            <p>Little tasks add up. If you only work with a small number of students, responding to emails, drip-feeding content, sending introduction emails to new learners, and maintaining a discussion forum may not take much effort. But as you scale, these tasks become overwhelming without automation.</p>

            <p>Start by identifying repetitive workflows: onboarding emails, FAQ responses, scheduling, and content delivery. Tools like email templates, automated drip sequences, and self-service knowledge bases can save significant time. For example, in my work with the Student Government Association, we created pre-written email templates. Any email scheduling a meeting was already drafted, and we simply updated the name and purpose before hitting send.</p>

            <p>A solid FAQ page and clear software guides also reduce support volume dramatically. The goal is to free up human time for the interactions that actually require a personal touch.</p>

            <h2>2. Develop a Student-Centered Approach</h2>

            <p>Leading institutions agree: the primary objective of any online strategy should be supporting students to complete their programs. McKinsey's research on scaling online education highlights three key student support mechanisms that successful institutions put in place:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized counseling and guidance</strong>: helping students navigate their academic journey with tailored support</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement with in-person and online communities</strong>: creating a sense of belonging even in virtual environments</li>
                <li><strong>24/7 IT support</strong>: ensuring the learning experience isn't disrupted by technical issues</li>
            </ul>

            <p>An important insight: students take the college experience holistically. When one service fails to deliver on expectations, the entire institution is affected. Every touchpoint matters.</p>

            <h2>3. Invest Heavily in Marketing</h2>

            <p>The biggest players in online education spend heavily on marketing. McKinsey's research shows that institutions with the largest online enrollment have marketing budgets comparable to fast-growth tech and digital retail companies. The correlation is clear: the more an institution invests in marketing, the higher its market share.</p>

            <p>This doesn't just mean buying ads. It means building a strong brand, telling compelling student stories, and meeting prospective learners where they are. CUNY, for example, has embraced this approach with targeted social media advertising for enrollment. If you're trying to scale, marketing isn't optional. It's a core operational function.</p>

            <h2>4. Don't Offer Every Course Every Term</h2>

            <p>A "course carousel" approach, rotating which courses are offered each term rather than running everything simultaneously, can significantly reduce costs while maintaining program quality. If you offer multiple start dates, many students will want to begin as quickly as possible, so you can still provide flexibility.</p>

            <p>In addition to the savings from the carousel model, institutions save money when the curriculum provides a clear path to graduation without excessive electives that add to program costs. CUNY follows this approach: most summer and winter classes are general education electives, while specialized courses run during fall and spring semesters. This model keeps operations lean while still serving students effectively.</p>

            <h2>5. Partner with Businesses</h2>

            <p>Strategic partnerships with employers will continue to be a key driver of growth for online programs. As technology and automation evolve, employers constantly need new skills and talent, and they're willing to invest in training that's aligned with their needs.</p>

            <p>The University of Arizona Online has partnered with organizations like Geico, Salt River Project, and Caterpillar to create curricula tailored to industry demands. CUNY has taken a similar approach, partnering with the New York City Jobs Council to offer the EverUp Micro-Credentials program: 100-hour online intensives certifying that students have mastered specific skills associated with high-demand jobs.</p>

            <p>These partnerships create a win-win: students get job-relevant skills and clear pathways to employment, while employers get access to a pipeline of qualified candidates.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Scaling online education requires more than good content. It demands intentional systems design: automating operations, centering the student experience, investing in visibility, being strategic about course offerings, and building bridges to the employers who will ultimately hire your graduates. The institutions that get this right aren't just growing. They're creating real economic mobility for their students.</p>
