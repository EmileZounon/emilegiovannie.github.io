            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Do you remember your favorite high school teacher? Mrs. Robinson. Regardless of your former teacher's name, I am sure you worked hard in their classes because you were either inspired by them or did not want to lose their attention. My favorite was my 11th-grade history teacher, a great man who taught us more than history. He encouraged critical thinking, ambition, and the pursuit of excellence, instilling in us the belief that we could contribute meaningfully to society.</p>

            <p>I have always admired dedicated teachers because they are at the heart of education, shaping the minds of millions of children every day just with their voices and chalkboards. But in today's digital age, the tools of the trade are evolving, from chalkboards to keyboards and from textbooks to tablets. However, for many educators across Sub-Saharan Africa, the journey to adopting EdTech feels daunting, marked by challenges like limited training, outdated infrastructure, and resistance to change.</p>

            <p>Yet, the potential is immense. With appropriate support and strategies, teachers can bridge the digital divide in classrooms and create transformative learning experiences for their students.</p>

            <h2>Challenges Teachers Face</h2>

            <p>Educators across Sub-Saharan Africa face significant barriers when it comes to integrating EdTech into their teaching:</p>

            <h3>Unequal Infrastructure and Access to Technology</h3>

            <p>Access to quality infrastructure varies per country across the region, which directly impacts the school system. In certain urban areas, access to electricity in schools is significantly higher, with some regions reporting access exceeding 50% for the first time. However, rural schools often experience drastically lower rates, with electricity access falling below 30%. In addition, data on how many schools have computers is scarce, but in most schools across the region, the principal's office or computer lab (if one exists) is often the only place with computers. Even then, the ratio of computers to students is far too low.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, we have a solution to our electricity problem: solar panels. We are fortunate to have sun all year round. Many clean-tech companies and regional solar entrepreneurs are using their skills to offer products and support to leverage this problem. Since 2014, Africa's solar capacity has nearly increased tenfold, from 1.67 gigawatts to 13.48 gigawatts in 2023, with the number of people connected to solar mini-grids increasing 50-fold. From a climate finance perspective, it is vital to recognize that massive investment in solar power grids is necessary to improve reliability and scalability over the long term. Targeted public-private partnerships can help equip schools with affordable, long-term digital solutions.</p>

            <h3>Professional Development Gaps and Limited Teacher Training</h3>

            <p>Many teachers do not receive continuous, relevant professional development focused on effective teaching practices. Hence, it is hard to expect them to integrate technology into the classroom if the basics are unmet. Studies consistently reveal that most teachers, especially in rural areas, have access only to sporadic, one-off workshops rather than sustained, context-specific professional development. As a result, fewer than 40% of educators in several countries report feeling adequately prepared to incorporate digital tools into their teaching practices.</p>

            <p>One solution is to shift from generic workshops to long-term, adaptive models that provide mentorship and hands-on digital skills support. In addition, teachers should be involved in co-designing training programs, ensuring that efforts align with their actual challenges and classroom demands.</p>

            <h3>Lack of Administrative Support and Resistance to Change</h3>

            <p>For many educators, the shift from traditional teaching methods to digital tools feels overwhelming or unnecessary, mainly when there is little institutional encouragement, financial incentive, or technical support. Many teachers earn low wages, leaving them with little time or motivation to explore new teaching methodologies like EdTech. Without economic incentives or workload adjustments, expecting educators to invest extra effort into digital adoption becomes unrealistic.</p>

            <p>Strong leadership with experience in EdTech should be in place to facilitate adoption in schools. School principals and district leaders should actively support and advocate for digital transformation by providing teachers with resources, time, and financial incentives to make digital learning an accessible and realistic part of classroom teaching rather than an added burden.</p>

            <h2>Actionable Steps for Educators</h2>

            <h3>Take Free or Affordable Training</h3>

            <p>Platforms like Teach2030, OER4Schools, Raspberry Pi Foundation, and IBM SkillsBuild provide free or low-cost courses on integrating technology into teaching. The Raspberry Pi Foundation offers training for teachers in coding and computing, helping educators introduce digital literacy without expensive resources. IBM SkillsBuild has many resources to support teachers in helping their students develop skills in Cybersecurity, data analytics, and AI. By enrolling in these programs, teachers can build confidence in using EdTech without financial barriers.</p>

            <h3>Leverage Low-Tech Solutions</h3>

            <p>Teachers can introduce offline learning apps, pre-loaded digital devices, or SMS-based learning platforms to support students in remote areas. Eneza Education's SMS-based learning system allows students in Kenya, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire to access quizzes and lessons via simple text messages, an ideal solution for schools with limited internet access. Tools like Kolibri also enable students to access digital learning content offline.</p>

            <h3>Focus on One Tool at a Time</h3>

            <p>Instead of trying to master multiple platforms at once, teachers can start with a single EdTech tool that aligns with their subject. A science teacher can use PhET Interactive Simulations (available offline) to demonstrate physics and chemistry experiments. A language teacher might introduce Google Docs for collaborative writing assignments. A math teacher can integrate GeoGebra, a free interactive tool for exploring graphs and equations, even offline.</p>

            <h3>Adapt Lessons for EdTech Tools</h3>

            <p>Teachers don't need to digitize their entire curriculum. Starting with just one lesson can be a practical approach. A history teacher can use the AfricanStory Book platform to access free open-source books in multiple African languages. A math teacher can create a Kahoot quiz to assess students' understanding in a fun and interactive way, even with just a single device in the classroom. Minor adaptations like these help teachers transition into digital teaching without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "I integrated EdTech into my classroom using tools like Kahoot! and Quizizz for fun, interactive quizzes that kept students engaged. Nearpod allowed for interactive lessons with polls and collaborative boards, while Padlet and Jamboard were used for group brainstorming. We explored Scratch to introduce AI and machine learning concepts and used Khan Academy and IXL for personalized practice in math and reading." - Kiki, IBM colleague and educator
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Advocate for Better Resources</h3>

            <p>Teachers should actively engage with school leaders, local governments, and education organizations to request EdTech tools, professional development opportunities, and infrastructure support. In Kenya, Tanzania, and Sierra Leone, teachers working with EdTech Hub's Tech4TPD program have implemented low-cost, tech-enhanced teaching strategies and received direct support from a global network of educators.</p>

            <h2>Call to Action</h2>

            <p>Teachers, you are the bridge between students and their future as citizens of different nations. By embracing technology, even in small ways, you can transform your classroom and inspire your students to reach new heights. What will you do today to ensure your students are prepared for tomorrow's world?</p>

            <p>In the meantime, I thank you for your fantastic service to students. We are all eternally grateful for your work.</p>
